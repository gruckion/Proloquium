Batch 1: Feature 1 - Autonomous Agent Framework

User story 1: Implement basic agent structure

Task: Design agent architecture

Research and choose a suitable architecture for agents
Define agent components and their responsibilities
Create a diagram to visualize the agent architecture
Task: Implement agent communication system

Choose a suitable communication protocol for agents
Develop a message-passing system for agents to exchange information
Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for communication
Task: Integrate LLMs and APIs

Research and select appropriate LLMs (e.g., GPT) and APIs for code generation
Implement interfaces to interact with LLMs and APIs
Create wrapper functions to simplify interaction with LLMs and APIs
User story 2: Define PromptTemplates, Agents, and Tools

Task: Set up LangChain

Install and configure LangChain for the project
Familiarize the team with LangChain's features and functionality
Create a repository to store PromptTemplates, agents, and tools
Task: Define PromptTemplates for code generation

Create a set of PromptTemplates for different types of code generation tasks
Implement a system for agents to select and use the appropriate PromptTemplate
Write test cases to validate the functionality of the PromptTemplates
Task: Create agents for different roles in SDLC

Define the roles and responsibilities of agents in the SDLC
Implement agents for requirements analysis, code generation, testing, and evaluation
Develop a system for agents to collaborate and interact during the SDLC
Task: Implement tools for code evaluation and testing

Research and select tools for code linting, formatting, and testing
Implement interfaces for agents to interact with these tools
Develop wrapper functions to simplify interaction with code evaluation and testing tools
Developers can follow these tasks for Feature 1 and ensure that the implementation of the autonomous agent framework is capable of handling the increasing complexity of the project. The tasks are designed to be actionable by junior developers and follow Test Driven Development (TDD) principles.
