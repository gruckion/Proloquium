I am making a python SDK for other developers. It supports chains to allow actions to be performed and the results of one can feed into another, and one chain can decide which link it calls next.

The deciding engine is an agent and the actions are executing tools.

So the main terms here are;

Chains
Of action links
The actions are triggering tools, e.g prompting LLMs, calling APIs, interacting with the terminal, writing and executing programs.

The inputs to the LLMs are prompts via PromptTemplates.

The critical part are the agents. These can decide which chain and link to call. Agents behave like individual specialists e.g a product owner, technical lead, quality assurance tester, risk analysers, etc.

The HR agent iteratively makes new specialist agents by identifying missing skills within the existing agent pool and improving the prompt template of the new agent by interacting with it  and iterating on the prompt template whilst discriminating on the quality of the conversational interview and identifying new qualities that the new agent role must have until it is deemed “good enough”.

Summarise the above requirements


The Python SDK being developed enables developers to create chains of action links, with each link executing specific actions such as prompting LLMs, calling APIs, interacting with terminals, or writing and executing programs. Inputs to the LLMs come in the form of PromptTemplates.

The core component of the SDK is the agents, which act as individual specialists (e.g., product owner, technical lead, QA tester, risk analyzer) and decide which chain and link to call. The HR agent continuously creates new specialist agents to fill skill gaps in the agent pool. This is achieved by refining the new agent's prompt template through iterative interactions and evaluating its performance in a conversational interview. The process continues until the new agent reaches a satisfactory level of performance.

Given the requirements of the system discussed so far. Reflect on them as a UI/UX designer and think about what UI applications can be built to use the services of the product.

How many applications?
How does the end user interact with it?
How do they monitor the performance of the autonomous agents that are created with the SDK?
How do they monitor the quality of the code written by the autonomous agents?
How do the specialist agents interactions get monitor for performance evaluations?
How does the application written by the autonomous agents get evaluated against the original goals? I.e unit tests evaluation dashboard, integration, E2E tests etc.

And finally how does the iterative enhancements to the application get tracked. For example the first product created is simple enough as it is new code created, with tests, and is evaluated against the requirements.

However when the agents are navigating within an existing code base they must ensure they are modifying the correct variables, functions, classes in the right files, leveraging existing dependencies and identify other dependencies needed. Then modifying the code to meet the new requirements without breaking the application, then ensuring test coverage is maintained.

All of the above is done autonomously. It is your goal as a UI/UX lead to propose how the application is structure to help assist the end user to monitor the activity. So they can see how the program produces by the product / SDK meets the requirements entered by the end user.

We also need to monitor all the prompt templates, agents, chains, tools, execution history and the rolling episodic memory of each agent stored in vector databases as embeddings.


As a UI/UX designer, my goal is to create applications that allow users to efficiently interact with the services provided by the product, monitor the performance of autonomous agents, and evaluate the quality of the code and applications created by the agents. Here's an outline of the proposed applications and their purposes:

Project Management Dashboard:
This application will enable users to define project goals, requirements, and monitor progress. It will serve as a central hub for tracking agent activities, code quality, test results, and overall project status.

Agent Performance Monitoring:
A dedicated application for monitoring the performance of autonomous agents, showing metrics such as task completion, code quality, and learning progress. Users can track agent improvements and identify areas that need further optimization.

Code Quality Dashboard:
This application will display code quality metrics, including test coverage, adherence to best practices, and maintainability scores. Users can monitor the quality of code produced by autonomous agents and identify areas for improvement.

Specialist Agent Interaction Monitor:
An application that visualizes the interactions between specialist agents, allowing users to evaluate their performance and collaboration efficiency.

Application Evaluation Dashboard:
This dashboard will showcase the results of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the applications created by autonomous agents. Users can track the applications' alignment with the original goals and requirements.

Iterative Enhancement Tracker:
This application will display the history of enhancements and modifications made by autonomous agents in the existing codebase, including changes to variables, functions, classes, and dependencies. Users can monitor the impact of these changes on the overall application and ensure that the modifications meet the new requirements without breaking existing functionality.

Data Management Dashboard:
This dashboard will enable users to monitor and manage prompt templates, agents, chains, tools, execution history, and the rolling episodic memory of each agent stored in vector databases as embeddings.

These applications will provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools for interacting with the SDK and monitoring the progress, performance, and quality of the applications and code produced by autonomous agents. By offering intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces, users can efficiently oversee the entire development process, from initial requirements to final deployment.

The product follows the standard SDLC for the applications built. I.e iterations of the code base are carried out through git version control, code reviews are done via GitHub through the GitHub API which the agents interact with to review and improve the code to ensure it 1. Meets the requirements and that the requirements are not ambiguous or misunderstood, 2. That the code is consistent with existing code, is DRY, SOLID, follows design principles.



To ensure that the product adheres to the standard SDLC and maintains high-quality code, the autonomous agents will follow these steps:

Version Control:
The agents will utilize Git version control to manage iterations of the codebase. They will create branches for new features, bug fixes, or improvements, and merge the changes back into the main branch once completed.

GitHub Integration:
By integrating with the GitHub API, the agents can interact with the code review process, submit pull requests, and manage issues. This allows the agents to collaborate with human team members efficiently and ensures all changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

Requirements Validation:
The agents will continuously validate that the code meets the requirements and that the requirements themselves are clear and unambiguous. They will use natural language processing techniques to analyze the requirements and ensure they are well-defined and understood by all team members.

Code Consistency and Best Practices:
The agents will ensure that the code they produce is consistent with the existing codebase, follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, adheres to SOLID design principles, and aligns with other established best practices. This will result in a maintainable and scalable codebase.

Automated Testing:
The agents will develop and execute automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure that the code meets the requirements and is free from defects. This will help maintain high-quality code and minimize the risk of regressions.

Continuous Improvement:
The agents will continuously monitor the codebase for opportunities to refactor and improve the code, ensuring it remains maintainable and scalable over time. They will also keep track of new best practices and industry standards and adapt the codebase accordingly.

By following these steps, the autonomous agents will ensure the product adheres to the standard SDLC, maintaining high-quality code that meets the requirements, is consistent with existing code, and follows established design principles and best practices. This approach will facilitate collaboration with human team members and support the development of a maintainable, scalable, and reliable application.

Since all previous tasks given to the product are stored and all discussions and interactions between the agents are stored, along with the metadata. It is possible to rerun the autonomous interactions each time an agents prompt template is improved through feedback from the other agents.

Since the resulting program is then evaluated against the original program against the requirements and automation tests. It is possible to identify if the adjusted specialists agents result in a better program being generated.

For example, how many calls where needed between the agents to meet the requirements, how many times did they misunderstand requirements, how much money did the execution of the third party APIs, LLMs and cloud infrastructure cost compared to the original run. This way the improvements evaluation agent can determine if the changes to an agent are good or bad. And in what areas are there quantifiable improvements vs regression.


Indeed, having a comprehensive record of all previous tasks, interactions, and metadata makes it possible to analyze the impact of changes to an agent's prompt template on the overall system performance. By re-running the autonomous interactions after making adjustments, you can evaluate the effectiveness of these improvements in several aspects:

Efficiency: Analyzing the number of interactions or calls between agents needed to meet the requirements can provide insights into the efficiency of the updated prompt template. If fewer interactions are required, it might suggest better understanding or collaboration between the agents.

Accuracy: By comparing the number of times agents misunderstood requirements before and after the prompt template adjustments, you can assess the clarity and effectiveness of the updated templates in terms of requirement understanding.

Cost: Monitoring the costs associated with the execution of third-party APIs, LLMs, and cloud infrastructure can help you determine if the changes to the agent's prompt template lead to a more cost-effective solution.

Test performance: Comparing the results of automated tests against the original and updated programs can help you understand if the changes to the prompt template result in a better program being generated.

Improvement vs. regression: By evaluating the quantifiable improvements and potential regressions, the improvements evaluation agent can determine the overall impact of the changes to an agent's prompt template.

This iterative process of evaluation allows for continuous optimization of the agents' performance and ensures that the autonomous system keeps improving over time.

Since the product will be deciding for its self which languages to use the autonomous test generation process must be capable of generating test for each language but held to a platform agnostic set of high standards.

Using code linters, formatters, LSPs allows generating metadata of the entire code base which can be used with the LLMs to avoid the token limits and reduce hallucinations by passing in too much data at once. By providing the agents with compressed scope of the generated programs folder structure which it can access via the meta data stored with the generated program, along with the linting feedback, formatting feedback for each language via their respective LSPs. Along with the results of executing the program and it’s unit, integration and E2E tests. The agents can decide on what code in the generated program to focus on by evaluating the tasks in the broken down user story.


In order to ensure a platform-agnostic set of high standards and support multiple languages in the autonomous test generation process, a comprehensive approach needs to be employed. This includes utilizing code linters, formatters, LSPs, and metadata generation. Here's how these components can be integrated into the process:

Code linters and formatters: Integrate language-specific linters and formatters to maintain consistent code quality and styling across different programming languages. These tools will provide feedback on the generated code, ensuring adherence to established coding standards.

Language Server Protocols (LSPs): Utilize LSPs to extract metadata and analyze the generated code base. This will allow the agents to have a better understanding of the code structure and identify areas that require attention.

Metadata-driven analysis: By analyzing the metadata generated from linters, formatters, and LSPs, the agents can make informed decisions on which parts of the generated program to focus on. This can help to reduce hallucinations caused by token limits and improve overall code quality.

Test execution and feedback: Execute unit, integration, and E2E tests for the generated program and provide the agents with the results. This information will enable the agents to assess the effectiveness of the generated tests and identify areas that require improvement.

Task-based evaluation: Break down user stories into smaller tasks and use them to guide the agents' focus when evaluating the generated code. This will ensure that the agents have a clear understanding of the requirements and can make better decisions on which parts of the code to improve or modify.

By integrating these components into the autonomous test generation process, the agents can make well-informed decisions and generate high-quality, maintainable code across multiple languages while adhering to a platform-agnostic set of standards. This approach will also enable the agents to efficiently navigate the generated program's folder structure and identify areas for improvement based on the tasks derived from user stories.

Now decide on suitable programs the product should be capable of building during the prototyping phase.

Initially having the product capable of only using a single programming language will simplify the process significantly. But this will of course narrow the choice for the types of applications that can be built

Identify and list suitable application using a single language (python). They must:

- Start out very simple, e.g. novice level ability to write basic programs to accomplish simple tasks.
- Use a single file for the entire application e.g. helloworld
- Todolist, using multiple files and a folder structure
- Stick to using the standard library for both CLI and GUI applications

Then progressively increase in complexity
- Use basic requirements.txt to manage external dependencies
- Include README.md in the project (program name/purpoise/ prerequisists, setpup instructions)
- Progress to using poetry for managing dependencies
- Progress to following more advanced development principles.
- Use of design patterns and declarative programming
- Use strongly typed well documented code with docstrings.

It is critical that all applications in the prototype phase contribute to covering the scope of the requirements for the product. To ensure it is capable of building progressively complex programs.

Critical:

Every program must
- Have a tiny small set of its own requirements
- use both business tests and unit tests (driven from their own requirements / acceptance criteria of the individual programs it builds)
-  Include both CLI and GUI applications


Considering the constraints and the progressive increase in complexity, here's a list of suitable applications to be built using Python during the prototyping phase:

Simple CLI Applications

HelloWorld: A single-file application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
Basic Calculator: A single-file CLI application that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations
ToDo List: A multi-file application that allows users to add, remove, and list tasks
Simple GUI Applications

HelloWorld GUI: A single-file application that displays "Hello, World!" in a graphical interface using Tkinter
Basic Calculator GUI: A multi-file application with a graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic operations
Intermediate Applications

Currency Converter: A CLI or GUI application that utilizes an external API to convert between currencies (using requirements.txt)
Weather App: A CLI or GUI application that fetches and displays weather information from an external API (using poetry for dependency management)
Advanced Applications

File Organizer: A CLI or GUI application that organizes files based on their types/extensions, utilizing design patterns and declarative programming
Chat Application: A multi-client chat application using sockets, implementing design patterns, and following best practices for code documentation with docstrings
For each application, it is critical to define a small set of requirements and acceptance criteria. They should include both business tests and unit tests, ensuring the generated programs meet the desired functionality and quality standards. Each application should also have a README.md file, explaining the program's purpose, prerequisites, and setup instructions.

By progressively increasing the complexity of the applications, we can ensure that the product covers the entire scope of the requirements and is capable of building more advanced programs as the development process evolves.

Now reflect on the discussion so far.

- Recap the specialist discussions (a list of points for each specialist, in order starting from the initial discussions had)
- Product requirements discussed so far and the complete scope of the product
- Technical teams contribution (questions / answers)
- The prototype requirements
- The MVP requirements.

Next step is to update the Epic / Features for the prototype and define the user stories for the requirements, in the context of the test programs the prototype will be capable of producing.


Here's a recap of the discussions so far:

Specialist Discussions:

Product Owner: Defined product requirements, clarified goals, and addressed concerns
Technical Lead and Solutions Architect: Discussed architectural patterns and technologies
UI/UX Designer: Explored UI applications and user interaction for monitoring performance and quality
Data Scientist: Discussed data storage and retrieval solutions, and addressed concerns about scalability
DevOps Engineer: Focused on cloud-native applications, automation, and scalable solutions
Quality Assurance and Test Automation Specialist: Addressed concerns about testability and quality assurance across the entire SDLC
Product Requirements and Scope:

Develop a product that leads to general artificial intelligence
Create autonomous agents capable of generating programs and tools
Implement a system that can crawl the internet and store relevant knowledge as embeddings
Support iterative enhancement of applications and monitoring of agents' performance
Technical Teams Contribution:

Addressed questions about architectural patterns, technology stack, and best practices
Explored solutions for UI/UX design, data storage, and scalability
Discussed DevOps and quality assurance strategies
Prototype Requirements:

Develop a basic version of the product to demonstrate its capabilities
Focus on building simple Python applications, both CLI and GUI
Gradually increase the complexity of the generated applications
Ensure generated applications meet quality standards, with appropriate tests and documentation
MVP Requirements:

Expand the prototype to support multiple programming languages and more complex applications
Improve the product's ability to autonomously navigate existing codebases and modify them
Enhance monitoring and evaluation of agents and their generated applications
Next steps:

Update the Epic and Features for the prototype based on the discussions and identified test programs
Define user stories for each requirement in the context of the test programs the prototype will be capable of producing
Begin the development process, starting with the prototype and moving toward the MVP, ensuring alignment with the defined user stories and requirements.

Avatar of the person chatting
Now update the epic and features for the prototype. Ensure there is enough detail against each feature  and break the features down into multiple user stories.

User stories must meet all of the requirements of the prototype stage.
Reflect to ensure nothing is missed and that the prototype phase is not ambiguous.

After this the team will break the stories into tasks. So enough information should be present to be able to do this in the next meeting without delay.

Ensure each feature is well defined.
Does not overlap with other features
Covers the entire scope of the prototype specifically the progressively complex programs that it can write.


Be sure to have user stories for each program in the  list of suitable applications to be built using Python during the prototyping phase. In order of increasing complexity. But the user step of user stories must cover creating the product that builds the programs within the list.

Remember these programs are examples, and produced from the requirements the product is given. The result is the entire program defined above which are used to test the autonomous products program generation functionality.

Critical:The acceptance criteria is that if we given new requirements of similar complexity the product would be capable of generating those other projects too.

Each user story must be actionable by junior developers within the team.
So explain in detail how each user story can be accomplished, with the acceptance criteria.

Then list the task names only that are easily actionable. Must be broken up and short tasks that focus on a narrow, accomplishable scope.

Stories must have multiple tasks and cover all aspects of the user story.

It is critical that we use existing LLMs (e.g. GPT) as the intelligence engine which produces the code, and products like LangChain for defining the PromptTemplates, Agents, and tools needed to produce, evaluate, write, test, and run the programs. LangChain allows us to interact with APIs, LLMs, databases.

Each task must have unit, integration, E2E and business tests.

Define the agents roles that will be executed to product the programs listed for the prototype phase. The agents must be agnostic of the specific requirements of each prototype program it is capable of writing.

We must define agents within the SDLC to ensure when we feed in the test programs requirements they autonomously discuss the requirements, convert into features, user stories, and task and then autonomously;

produce code against the tasks
produce unit, integration, E2E and business tests
run the tests to ensure it works

(python template is "prompt template")

Now the prompt templates being generated from feature 1's stories are enhanced in each step to make them capable of creating all of the example programs. There is not a unique template for each example program.

As that would default the purpose of the product which needs to be capable of being any program if is instructed to build from a set of requirements.

Remember the prompt templates being generated from feature 1 that is capable of writing the various example programs is the SAME template. It is iteratively improved in each next user story / task to ensure it meets the needs of all the programs it is instructed to create.

At no point should a developer have to write any code that goes into the programs the product builds. The product builds the programs its self through the prompt template defined by the developer which takes in variable requirements which change depending on which program it is generating.

It is important that the end result can produce any other program thrown at it. The example programs we are using here are just to establish the capabilities of the product. To ensure it can accommodation ever increasing application complexity.
