Step 1: Define the Epic

Title: Autonomous Software Development Prototype

Description: Develop a functional prototype of an autonomous software development system, capable of generating programs with multiple files, languages, and dependencies, while following the SDLC, agile methodologies, and maintaining high code quality.

Step 2: Define the Features

Feature 1: Agent Creation and Management

Develop agents with different capabilities (e.g., code generation, test generation, quality assurance)
Implement agent interaction, collaboration, and feedback mechanisms
Monitor agent performance and continuously refine their abilities
Feature 2: Integration with Existing Tools and Technologies

Identify and integrate relevant LLMs, APIs, and third-party services
Establish compatibility with existing systems and tools
Ensure seamless integration and communication between components
Feature 3: Program Generation and Management

Autonomously generate multi-file programs using various languages and dependencies
Maintain internal and external dependencies within the program's repository
Apply suitable design patterns and adhere to coding best practices
Feature 4: Test Generation and Quality Assurance

Generate unit, integration, and E2E tests for the autonomously created programs
Employ code linters, formatters, and LSPs to ensure code quality and maintainability
Continuously evaluate and improve the testability of generated programs
Feature 5: Performance Evaluation and Monitoring

Implement performance metrics and evaluation methods for agents and generated programs
Create a monitoring dashboard to track the progress and success of the agents
Utilize collected data to guide future improvements and iterations
These features will form the basis for the prototype's development. Once the features are defined, they can be further broken down into user stories to guide the development process and ensure that all aspects of the prototype are addressed in a systematic and organized manner.

After reflecting on the Epic and Features breakdown, it appears to be well-suited for a prototype. The scope is neither too limited nor too advanced for a pre-MVP stage. Each feature focuses on a critical aspect of the system, and they are complementary to each other. However, we can make a few adjustments to ensure that the prototype remains focused and efficient.

Updated Step 2: Define the Features

Feature 1: Basic Agent Creation and Management

Develop a limited number of essential agents with distinct capabilities (e.g., code generation, test generation, quality assurance)
Implement a basic agent interaction and collaboration mechanism
Monitor agent performance and gather feedback for future refinements

Feature 2: Integration with Key Existing Tools and Technologies

Identify and integrate a few essential LLMs, APIs, and third-party services
Establish compatibility with a limited set of commonly used systems and tools
Demonstrate effective communication between core components

Feature 3: Simple Program Generation and Management

Autonomously generate basic programs with a limited number of files, languages, and dependencies
Manage dependencies within the program's repository at a basic level
Apply fundamental design patterns and adhere to essential coding best practices

Feature 4: Basic Test Generation and Quality Assurance

Generate simple unit tests for the autonomously created programs
Employ basic code linters and formatters to ensure essential code quality
Evaluate generated programs and identify areas for future improvement

Feature 5: Initial Performance Evaluation and Monitoring

Implement basic performance metrics for agents and generated programs
Create a simple monitoring dashboard to track agent progress
Utilize collected data to guide improvements in future iterations
By streamlining the features and focusing on core functionality, we can ensure that the prototype is not too advanced for the pre-MVP stage. This approach will allow us to validate essential concepts before investing more resources into developing the full-fledged system.
