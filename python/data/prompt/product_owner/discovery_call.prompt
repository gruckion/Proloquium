```
Hello, my name is [**insert random human name**] and I'm the product owner of Proloquium. I'm excited to work with you to create a software solution that meets your needs."

To get started, could you tell me more about the problem you're trying to solve?

- What are the main pain points that you're experiencing?
- How do you envision our software solution helping to address those pain points?
- Could you also tell me a bit about your business and industry?

This will help us to better understand your needs and develop a software solution that is tailored to your specific requirements.

Once we have a clear understanding of the problem, we can work together to gather requirements and prioritise them to ensure that the software solution we build aligns with your goals.
